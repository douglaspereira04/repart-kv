# KeyStorage Test Suite Results

## Overview

The generic KeyStorage test suite (`test_keystorage`) tests all KeyStorage implementations with comprehensive tests including:
- Basic get/put operations
- Direct lower_bound tests
- Iterator incrementation
- Scan operations (using lower_bound + iterator)
- Large datasets
- Special characters
- Numeric value ranges

## Test Results Summary

**Total Tests:** 171 (19 tests × 3 storage types × 3 value types)  
**Passed:** 171 ✅  
**Failed:** 0  

### By Storage Implementation

#### ✅ MapKeyStorage - 57/57 PASSED
- **int:** 19/19 ✓
- **long:** 19/19 ✓
- **uint64_t:** 19/19 ✓

**Status:** All tests passing. MapKeyStorage uses `std::map` which maintains sorted order naturally.

#### ✅ TkrzwHashKeyStorage - 57/57 PASSED
- **int:** 19/19 ✓
- **long:** 19/19 ✓
- **uint64_t:** 19/19 ✓

**Status:** All tests passing. TkrzwHashKeyStorage now implements sorted iteration by:
1. Collecting all keys from the hash database
2. Sorting them in memory
3. Maintaining a shared sorted key list in the iterator
4. Fetching values from the database on demand

**Note:** This approach trades memory and CPU (O(n log n) sort) for functionality. For truly large datasets with frequent iterations, consider TkrzwTreeKeyStorage instead.

#### ✅ TkrzwTreeKeyStorage - 57/57 PASSED
- **int:** 19/19 ✓
- **long:** 19/19 ✓  
- **uint64_t:** 19/19 ✓

**Status:** All tests passing. TkrzwTreeKeyStorage uses TreeDBM which maintains sorted order natively.

## How TkrzwHashKeyStorage Implements Sorted Iteration

### Implementation Strategy
`TkrzwHashKeyStorage` uses TKRZW's HashDBM, which is a hash-based database that **does not natively maintain sorted key order**. To support the KeyStorage interface requirement for sorted iteration, we implement it manually:

### Technical Details

From `TkrzwHashKeyStorage.h`:
```cpp
// HashDBM doesn't maintain sorted order, so we need to:
// 1. Collect all keys
// 2. Sort them
// 3. Find the lower_bound position
// 4. Create an iterator with the sorted keys starting from that position
```

The iterator maintains:
- `std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::string>>` - Sorted list of all keys (shared ownership)
- `size_t current_index_` - Current position in the sorted list
- Fetches values from the database on demand using `storage_->get()`

### Performance Characteristics

**TkrzwHashKeyStorage lower_bound():**
- Time: O(n log n) where n = total number of keys
- Space: O(n) for the sorted key list
- First call expensive, but iterator increments are O(1) in memory + O(1) database lookup

**Comparison:**
- `MapKeyStorage`: O(log n) lower_bound, native sorted iteration
- `TkrzwTreeKeyStorage`: O(log n) lower_bound, native sorted iteration
- `TkrzwHashKeyStorage`: O(n log n) lower_bound, simulated sorted iteration

## Recommendations

### When to Use Each Implementation

**Use MapKeyStorage when:**
- In-memory storage is acceptable
- Dataset fits in RAM
- Need sorted iteration
- Simplicity is important

**Use TkrzwHashKeyStorage when:**
- Need persistent storage
- Only performing random access (get/put)
- Write performance is critical
- Don't need sorted iteration
- Key distribution is uniform

**Use TkrzwTreeKeyStorage when:**
- Need persistent storage
- Require sorted iteration
- Performing range queries or scans
- Need lower_bound operations
- Willing to accept slightly slower writes for sorted access

### Trade-offs

**TkrzwHashKeyStorage is now fully functional** but with performance trade-offs:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Supports all KeyStorage operations
- ✅ Maintains O(1) get/put operations
- ✅ Persistent storage
- ✅ Passes all tests

**Cons:**
- ⚠️  First lower_bound() call is O(n log n)
- ⚠️  Stores all keys in memory during iteration
- ⚠️  Not optimal for frequent scans of large datasets

**Recommendation:** For scan-heavy workloads on large datasets, use TkrzwTreeKeyStorage instead.

## Test Categories

### Category 1: Basic Operations (Always Pass)
- put/get operations
- Overwrite values
- Empty keys
- Special characters
- Numeric ranges

All storage types handle these correctly.

### Category 2: Exact Lookups (Always Pass)
- Exact key matches
- Non-existent keys

Hash storage excels at these operations.

### Category 3: Sorted Operations (Hash Storage Fails)
- lower_bound with prefix matching
- Sorted iteration
- Ordered scans
- Partial prefix scans

These operations require sorted storage (Tree or Map).

## Running the Tests

```bash
cd build
./test_keystorage
```

### Expected Output
